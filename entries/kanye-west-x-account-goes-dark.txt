It was not immediately clear if the artiste and entrepreneur, who legally changed his name to Ye, deactivated the account himself or if X took it down.

Kanye West's account on X has been deactivated after a days-long rant on the platform that included vitriolic, anti-Semitic outbursts.
It was not immediately clear if the artiste and entrepreneur, who legally changed his name to Ye, deactivated the account himself or if X took it down.
"I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate Elon for allowing me to vent. It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board," he wrote in his final post, referring to the owner of X, Elon Musk.
It's a familiar pattern for Ye, 47, who is now in the headlines as often for his provocative, often hate-filled rants as he is for his music.
The rapper has been locked out of social media platforms in the past, notably when he was banned from X for nearly eight months for violating rules barring incitement to violence.
Ye's most recent missives included comments in support of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who is imprisoned on sex trafficking charges. He repeatedly referred to himself as a "Nazi".
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
For years, Ye has spoken openly about struggles with bipolar disorder. He recently said on The Download podcast that he in fact has an autism diagnosis.
